    "Jo hits with probability $p = 0.3$ and Flo hits with probability $q = 0.7$. Jo wins _if_ he hits at the first chuck, _or else if_ Flo misses at her first chuck _and_ Jo hits at his second chuck and so on _till_ the last attempt. Based on the above, the probability that Jo hits at his first chuck is just $p$, the probability that Jo hits at the second chuck is $p(1 - p)(1 - q)$, at the third chuck $p[(1 - p)(1 - q)]^2$ and so on. \n",
