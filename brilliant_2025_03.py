"""
Bored at work, you start typing random keys on your keyboard. 
Are you more likely to type EAT or ATE first?

Bonus: The random typing continues. 
What is the probability that you type TALES before STALE?
"""


# Solution

"""
If the total distance traveled by a user's finger is shorter for one sequence 
than another, then that sequence is more likely to be typed.

For example:
 - EA is distance between keys `E` and `A` on a keyboard, the same for AT and TE.
 - If EA + AT < AT + TE, then it is more likely that the user will type "EAT".
 - If EA + AT > AT + TE, then it is more likely that the user will type "ATE."
 - Otherwise, "ATE" and "EAT" are equally likely to be typed.

Assume all keyboard keys are square-shaped, with dimensions of 1 unit by 1 unit.
Each key in the layer below is positioned exactly in the middle of two keys in the layer above.
Thus, we can model the keyboard as a parallelogram grid with angles `a` and `180Â° - a`.
The coordinate of a key is defined as the coordinate of the lower-left corner of its cell in the grid.

"""
We know that the user typed either `TALES` or `STALES`. Typing `TALES` before 
`STALES` means:
1. The letter `S` was typed after typing `TALE`.
2. Conversely, typing `STALES` before `TALES` means the letter `S` was typed before `TALE`. 

Effectively, this means that the probability of typing "TALES" before "STALES" 
is the same as the probability of condition 1 occurring.
